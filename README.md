# How does it work ?

### Include the necessary libraries.

### I create the matrix that will preview the cells with their corresponding position number and I create another matrix which we will change its content each turn to be able to draw the "X" and "O".

### Then we create the variable "turns" which, as its name indicates, refers to the game's turns, and we set it to 9, since it is the maximum number of cells in the game.

### We are going to create the prototype functions, which we will use later.

### We now go on to create the "main" function, which will be the first to be executed. The first thing this function does is welcome the player and show which symbol (X or O) is for each player, and then through two "for loops" it prints all the positions on the screen. We can see that at the end we call the "play" function.

### This function will display this on the screen:

I will continue soon...
